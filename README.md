# burger

Code performs most of the required functionality.  It does not automatically render an updated page after clicking the "Eat It" button, however.  The button does update the status in the database from devoured = false to devoured = true, but you have to manually refresh the page to move the burger to the right hand side of the screen.  I spent hours trying to resolve the problem and consulted with both Mark P and Darren Kay but was ultimately unable to fix it.

No styling applied beyond what came with the bootstrap code snippet that set up the format.  All of my time was spent chasing the page refresh problem.
